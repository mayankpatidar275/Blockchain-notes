Geth is a software helps us to become the node of ethereum network and communicate.

Defination: Geth(Go Ethereum) is a command line interface for running ethereum node implemented in Go Language.
Using Geth we can join Ethereum network, transfer ether between accounts or even mine ethers.

Installation:
Starts connecting you with the peers and brings the blocks to your system.
Requires more space (512 gb).

Running geth on fast sync mode: only brings some part of the blockchain i.e header.
Full sync mode: brings the complete blockchain.
Requires lots of space and time...might take 2 to 3 weeks.

Keeping geth running in one terminal and using other terminal to interact with the blockchain (creating the account and several other operations)

You can see the blocks of the blockchain in the folder(chaindata) in the form of files.


Creating our own private network:
creating genesis.json
We need to provide the chain id, which doesnt exist already.
