Why IPFS ?

Decentralized application:
If we starts storing large files like images and videos on blockchain, it would require high gas fees (i.e., it would be very costly).
Alternate solution -> connect your dapp with server which will store your data on database.
But but but doing so will hamper the essense of blockchain i.e., decentralisation.
So the solution for this problem is IPFS.

What is IPFS ?
-> IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a peer to peer, decentralized and distributed filesystem.

-> IPFS uses DHT(distributed hash table) and Merkle DAG(directed acyclic graph) data structures.
->It uses a protocol similar to BitTorrent to decide how to move data around the network.
-> It uses Content Addressing rather than Location Addressing.


Location Addressing :
You use a Uniform resource locator (URL) to send the request to the server.
It locates the website on the server.

It doesnt goes like that in IPFS.
Whenever you upload any file on IPFS, it performs hashing on it (generally uses SHA256) and gives the hash.
Now to identify that particular entity we use its hash instead of location.


IPFS vs HTTP :
In the below diagram you can see that any person in the network can request the data from any other person in the network.
On the other hand in HTTP the client can access the data only through the server.


table:
IPFS
-> Content Addressing 
-> No one control it
-> Efficient
-> Data is persistent
-> Cannot go down

HTTP
-> Location Addressing
-> Controlled by the location owner
-> Not efficient
-> Data is not persistent
-> Can go down

Working of IPFS:
The machine that runs IPFS software to store and retrieve files from the IPFS network is called the IPFS node.

Initially lets say any node add a image file to IPFS. 
Now the data is in the cache of that node.
Now the other node can request for this data from A.
If a node is connected to more than one node and the data is available to more than one node then it will take the datt form all the node in parts.
this all things are managed by IPFS protocol.

If some of the node will get off the data could be retrieved from the others unlike server.
